      <p>
        I'm currently a CSE student at SRM University, Chennai, with a passion for software development and a keen interest in exploring the world of AI. I can speak English and Hindi fluently, and I'm a beginner in French. My love for new cultures drives me to constantly expand my horizons.

        I was born and raised in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, where I developed a strong interest in the way technology affects behavior in society. I am a dedicated learner with a solid foundation in web development, proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and currently exploring frameworks and backend technologies. While I continue to strengthen my problem-solving skills through platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank, I am also passionate about journaling, Indian mythology, and cooking. Familiar with a variety of cuisines, I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen and exploring global flavors. In my free time, I find balance through reading and playing badminton.
